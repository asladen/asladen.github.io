&lt;p&gt;In order to address the critical lack of data on the dynamics and physical evolution of the seafloor (coastal erosion, tectonic or volcanic motions, gravitational instabilities, etc.), we are exploring the potential of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_optic_sensor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensing&lt;/a&gt; (DFOS) technology to complement or improve existing seafloor monitoring techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DFOS is a promising technique allowing to quantify deformation, temperature and/or acoustic signals typically every meter of a standard optic fiber cable and over distances of several tenths of kilometers. The physical principle is not new but decades of improvements in the price and performance of the components make it a potential affordable alternative to standard seafloor instrumentation. Compared to traditional electro-mechanical sensors, optical fibers have many advantages: they are passive, lightweight, small, immune to electromagnetic interferences and tolerant to harsh environments (temperature and pressure). Data acquisition and transfer is also fast and efficient because it relies on a large bandwidth and offers opportunities for multiplexing. DFOS has become a standard monitoring approach for civil engineering or oil exploration, but its potential for seafloor applications remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main strategies to harness the potential of DFOS, either through the deployment of a dedicated cable, or the use of cables in place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;existing-fiber-optic-cables&#34;&gt;Existing fiber optic cables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the telecom industry, the seafloors are already largely covered with fiber optic cables. The challenge here is to define the potential of these large infrastructures to provide meaningful geophysical signals, as they are not designed for measurements: instead, telecommunication cables are optimized such that the optical fibers at the core of the cable are isolated from external forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sladen, A., Rivet, D., Ampuero, J., De Barros, L., Hello, Y., Calbris, G., &amp;amp; Lamare, P. (2019, June 7). Distributed sensing of earthquakes and ocean-solid Earth interactions on seafloor telecom cables. &lt;em&gt;EarthArXiv&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/ekrfy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/ekrfy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dedicated-fiber-optic-cables&#34;&gt;Dedicated fiber optic cables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, places of geophysical interest might not be covered with optical fiber cables. The thick armored cables used by the telecom industry are too expensive for academic applications. Instead, we are developing a lightweight plow to trench thin fiber optic cables inside the sediments of the seafloor. Trenching the cable allows to improve the coupling and protect the thin cable from fishing activities. Our plow system was first tested and validated in 2018 offshore the Nice airport, France. The first deployment of fiber optic cables is scheduled in the same area in 2019. The area offshore the Nice airport is both a convenient local test site but also an area of great scientific and societal interest: the seafloor shows many signs of fluid seepage and the steep slopes might be prone to destabilization; in 1979, a submarine landslide triggered a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_Nice_tsunami&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;local tsunami&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The earthquake source</title>
      <link>https://asladen.github.io/project/eq_src/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the first high quality seismograms and the development of theoretical models in the
1960s, it is established that earthquakes ruptures are complex (e.g. Archuleta and Frazier,
1978; Das and Kostrov, 1990). Over the few seconds or minutes of its duration, earthquake
ruptures can go through various stages of acceleration, arrest, large slip or no slip. Given our
inability to directly measure what is happening on the fault, remote imagery of fault slip evolution
on the fault is a key element to understand what controls earthquake ruptures. It is also a
necessary step towards a finer description of the seismic cycle (how ruptures repeat over time),
and the prediction of generated ground motions (what causes building destruction and tsunami
waves).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of studies have investigated this complexity using data, first mostly relying on data
from the global seismic networks and then, around the 1990s, using satellite based technologies such as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gsa.europa.eu/european-gnss/what-gnss&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GNSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;InSAR&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tectonics.caltech.edu/slip_history/spot_coseis/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;optical imagery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the continuous development of instrumentation, earthquake ruptures (and by extension any slip episode on a fault) remain challenging to image:
signals are always recorded at the surface, spatial and/or temporal resolution of data is usually limited,
data might be biased (e.g. collected one month after the earthquake), our knowledge of the Earth structure is often limited, as well as the physics of the
processes involved.
To address these issues, my collaborators and I, have developped different methodological approaches to address a number of limitations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;incorporate more data, of different types and sensitivies&lt;/strong&gt;. In the case of well instrumented earthquakes, our description of earthquake rupture can be based on teleseismic data, near-field strong motion, tsunami, GPS, radar images and/or optical images (e.g. Bletery et al.,2014),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;analyze data with probabilistic (Bayesian) algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;. This formalism limits the amount of ad hoc assumptions (e.g. regularisation, imposing a priori information which is not well defined), and allows to estimate uncertainties on our final models (e.g. Simons et al., 2011; Bletery et al., 2016),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;devise a formalism to acknowledge model (epistemic) uncertainties&lt;/strong&gt;. We show that this type of development leads to more robust images of fault slip history. It is a necessary approach given that our knowledge of the Earth structure will always be, at least to some extent, limited (e.g. Ragon et al., 2018),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;explicitely account for limitations of the measurements&lt;/strong&gt;. Very often, data are acquired at the wrong time, with limited spatial coverage, or else. By developping strategies to acknowledge these limitations, it is possible to improve the robutness, and sometimes resolution, of the sought-after model (e.g. Bletery et al., 2018; Ragon et al., 2019),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;move towards more advanced physics (forward problem)&lt;/strong&gt;, when possible and useful. Within the PhD project of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hector_Perez_Alemany&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hector Alemany&lt;/a&gt;, and in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vadim_Monteiller&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vadim Monteiller&lt;/a&gt;, earthquake wave simulation in 3D complex media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
