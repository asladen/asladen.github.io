The physical principle is not new but decades of improvements in the price and performance of the components make it a potential affordable alternative to standard seafloor instrumentation. Compared to traditional electro-mechanical sensors, optical fibers have many advantages: they are passive, lightweight, small, immune to electromagnetic interferences and tolerant to harsh environments (temperature and pressure). Data acquisition and transfer is also fast and efficient because it relies on a large bandwidth and offers opportunities for multiplexing. DFOS has become a standard monitoring approach for civil engineering or oil exploration, but its potential for seafloor applications remains largely unexplored.\nThere are two main strategies to harness the potential of DFOS, either through the deployment of a dedicated cable, or the use of cables in place:\nExisting fiber optic cables Thanks to the telecom industry, the seafloors are already largely covered with fiber optic cables. The challenge here is to define the potential of these large infrastructures to provide meaningful geophysical signals, as they are not designed for measurements: instead, telecommunication cables are optimized such that the optical fibers at the core of the cable are isolated from external forces.\n Sladen, A., Rivet, D., Ampuero, J., De Barros, L., Hello, Y., Calbris, G., \u0026amp; Lamare, P. (2019, June 7). Distributed sensing of earthquakes and ocean-solid Earth interactions on seafloor telecom cables. EarthArXiv, https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/ekrfy  Dedicated fiber optic cables In many cases, places of geophysical interest might not be covered with optical fiber cables. The thick armored cables used by the telecom industry are too expensive for academic applications. Instead, we are developing a lightweight plow to trench thin fiber optic cables inside the sediments of the seafloor. Trenching the cable allows to improve the coupling and protect the thin cable from fishing activities. Our plow system was first tested and validated in 2018 offshore the Nice airport, France. The first deployment of fiber optic cables is scheduled in the same area in 2019. The area offshore the Nice airport is both a convenient local test site but also an area of great scientific and societal interest: the seafloor shows many signs of fluid seepage and the steep slopes might be prone to destabilization; in 1979, a submarine landslide triggered a local tsunami.\n","date":1556323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556323200,"objectID":"d98143babf3678541845fcad5a7c4d2a","permalink":"https://asladen.github.io/project/fiber/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fiber/","section":"project","summary":"Exploiting fiber optic cable to instrument oceans","tags":["fiber"],"title":"Seafloor fiber optic sensing","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Image Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

Uncertainties in our physical models will naturally bias our inferences of subsurface fault slip. These uncertainties will always persist to some level as we will never have a perfect knowledge of the Earth’s interior. The choice of the forward physics is thus ambiguous, with the frequent need to fix the value of several parameters such as crustal properties or fault geometry. Here, we explore the impact of uncertainties related to the choice of both fault geometry and elastic structure, as applied to the 2016 Mw 6.2 Amatrice earthquake, central Italy. This event, well instrumented and characterized by a relatively simple fault morphology, allows us to explore the role of uncertainty in basic fault parameters, such as fault dip and position. We show that introducing uncertainties in fault geometry in a static inversion reduces the sensitivity of inferred models to different geometric assumptions. Accounting for uncertainties thus helps infer more realistic and robust slip models. We also show that uncertainties in fault geometry and Earth’s elastic structure significantly impact estimated source models, particularly if near-fault observations are available.","tags":["eq_src cycle"],"title":"Accounting for uncertain fault geometry in earthquake source inversions--II: application to the M w 6.2 Amatrice earthquake, central Italy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Sladen","Diane Rivet","Jean-Paul Ampuero","Yann Hello","Gaëtan Calbris","Patrick Lamare"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"3b931f66888fbdd77d598b631b4af63a","permalink":"https://asladen.github.io/publication/content/preprint/sladen-2019-distributed/","publishdate":"2019-07-20T11:12:03.846371Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/preprint/sladen-2019-distributed/","section":"publication","summary":"Two thirds of the surface of our planet are covered by water and are still poorly instrumented, which has prevented the earth science community from addressing numerous key scientific questions.

Here, we report Distributed Acoustic Sensing measurements on a 41.5 km-long telecom cable that is deployed offshore Toulon, France. Our observations demonstrate the capability to monitor with unprecedented details the ocean-solid earth interactions from the coast to the abyssal plain, in addition to regional seismicity (e.g., a magnitude 1.9 micro-earthquake located 100 km away) with signal characteristics comparable to those of a coastal seismic station.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Distributed sensing of earthquakes and ocean-solid Earth interactions on seafloor telecom cables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Louisa LH Tsang","Mathilde Vergnolle","Cedric Twardzik","Anthony Sladen","Jean-Mathieu Nocquet","Frédérique Rolandone","Hans Agurto-Detzel","Olivier Cavalié","Paul Jarrin","Patricia Mothes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d4a212d90271b1dd66591f293e7bc942","permalink":"https://asladen.github.io/publication/content/publication/tsang-2019-imaging/","publishdate":"2019-08-17T10:19:34.485218Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/tsang-2019-imaging/","section":"publication","summary":"High-Rate (HR) GPS time series following the 2016 Mw 7.8 Pedernales earthquake suggest significant postseismic deformation occurring in the early postseismic period (i.e. first few hours after the earthquake) that is not resolved with daily GPS time series. To understand the characteristics of early postseismic deformation, and its relationship with the mainshock rupture area, aftershocks and longer-term postseismic deformation, we estimate the spatio-temporal distribution of early afterslip with HR-GPS time series that span ∼2.5 min to 72 hr after the earthquake, and compare with afterslip models estimated with daily GPS time series spanning a similar postseismic time period and up to 30 days after the earthquake. Inversion of the HR-GPS time series enables us to image the initiation of afterslip in the initial hours after the earthquake, bringing us closer to the transition between the coseismic and postseismic phases. The spatial signature of early afterslip in the region updip of the mainshock rupture area is consistent with longer-term afterslip that occurs in the 30-day postseismic period, indicating that afterslip initiated updip of and adjacent to peak coseismic slip asperities, in two localised areas, and subsequently continued to grow in amplitude with time in these specific areas. A striking difference, however, is that inversion of the 72-hour HR-GPS time series suggests early afterslip within the mainshock rupture area, but which may have been short-lived. Finally, using the first daily GPS position as the origin of the postseismic displacement (here at 12 hr after the earthquake) biases the postseismic geodetic moment, with ∼60% missing over the first 72 hr, that corresponds to ∼10% over the first 30 days. The results of our study demonstrate that imaging the spatio-temporal evolution of afterslip using subdaily GPS time series is important for evaluating postseismic slip budgets, and provides additional insights into the postseismic slip behaviour of faults.","tags":["eq_src cycle"],"title":"Imaging rapid early afterslip of the 2016 Pedernales earthquake, Ecuador","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cedric Twardzik","Mathilde Vergnolle","Anthony Sladen","Antonio Avallone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"dc7aaa86ca3df3eb4d9aecf0d7a618cc","permalink":"https://asladen.github.io/publication/content/publication/twardzik-2019-unravelling/","publishdate":"2019-07-20T11:12:03.84511Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/twardzik-2019-unravelling/","section":"publication","summary":"After large earthquakes, parts of the fault continue to slip for days to months during the afterslip phase, a behaviour documented for many earthquakes. Yet, little is known about the early stage, i.e., from minutes to hours after the mainshock. Its detailed study requires continuous high-rate position time series close to the fault, and advanced signal processing to accurately extract the surface displacements. Here, we use refined kinematic precise point positioning processing to document the early postseismic deformation for three earthquakes along the South American subduction zone (2010 Mw8.8 Maule, Chile; 2015 Mw8.3 Illapel, Chile; 2016 Mw7.6 Pedernales, Ecuador). First, we show that early afterslip generates significant surface displacement as early as a few tens of minutes after the earthquake. Our analysis of the time series indicates that, over the first 36 hours, more than half of the displacement occurs within the first 12 hours, a time window often disregarded with daily positioning. Thus, estimates of coseismic offsets can be biased by more than 10% if early postseismic displacements are acknowledged as coseismic ones.

Observational errors are usually accounted for in the inversion process. Epistemic errors, which stem from our simplified description of the forward problem, are rarely dealt with despite their potential to bias the estimate of a source model. In this study, we explore the impact of uncertainties related to the choice of a fault geometry in source inversion problems. The geometry of a fault structure is generally reduced to a set of parameters, such as position, strike and dip, for one or a few planar fault segments. While some of these parameters can be solved for, more often they are fixed to an uncertain value. We propose a practical framework to address this limitation by following a previously implemented method exploring the impact of uncertainties on the elastic properties of our models. We develop a sensitivity analysis to small perturbations of fault dip and position. The uncertainties of our fixed fault geometry are included in the inverse problem under the formulation of the misfit covariance matrix that combines both prediction and observation uncertainties. We validate this approach with the simplified case of a fault that extends infinitely along strike, using both Bayesian and optimization formulations of a static slip inversion. If epistemic errors are ignored, predictions are overconfident in the data and slip parameters are not reliably estimated. In contrast, inclusion of uncertainties in fault geometry allows us to infer a robust posterior slip model. Epistemic uncertainties can be many orders of magnitude larger than observational errors for great earthquakes (Mw  8). Not accounting for uncertainties in fault geometry may partly explain observed shallow slip deficits for continental earthquakes. Similarly, ignoring the impact of epistemic errors can also bias estimates of near-surface slip and predictions of tsunamis induced by megathrust earthquakes.","tags":["eq_src cycle"],"title":"Accounting for uncertain fault geometry in earthquake source inversions--I: theory and simplified application","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Sladen","Jenny Trevisan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"0f0f48ecf9d3d8dc6850af9ad58cd3d6","permalink":"https://asladen.github.io/publication/content/publication/sladen-2018-shallow/","publishdate":"2019-07-20T11:12:03.844033Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/sladen-2018-shallow/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Shallow megathrust earthquake ruptures betrayed by their outer-trench aftershocks signature","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Louis De Barros","Anne Deschamps","Anthony Sladen","Hélène Lyon-Caen","Nicholas Voulgaris"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"76458de4359b4157b449b1e6785919d9","permalink":"https://asladen.github.io/publication/content/publication/de-2017-investigating/","publishdate":"2019-07-20T11:12:03.84348Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/de-2017-investigating/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Investigating dynamic triggering of seismicity by regional earthquakes: The case of the Corinth Rift (Greece)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-M Nocquet","P Jarrin","M Vallée","PA Mothes","R Grandin","Frédérique Rolandone","B Delouis","H Yepes","Yvonne Font","D Fuentes"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"2bdeb4bd48e97b5e3b426a2af5b56385","permalink":"https://asladen.github.io/publication/content/publication/nocquet-2017-supercycle/","publishdate":"2019-07-20T11:12:03.842851Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/nocquet-2017-supercycle/","section":"publication","summary":"Large earthquakes are usually assumed to release all of the strain accumulated since the previous event, implying a reduced seismic hazard after them. However, long records of seismic history at several subduction zones suggest supercycle behaviour, where centuries-long accumulated strain is released through clustered large earthquakes, resulting in an extended period of enhanced seismic hazard. Here we combine historical seismology results, present-day geodesy data, and dense local observations of the recent Mw 7.8 2016 Pedernales earthquake to reconstruct the strain budget at the Ecuador subduction zone since the great 1906 earthquake. We show that the Pedernales earthquake involved the successive rupture of two patches on the plate interface that were locked prior to the earthquake and most probably overlaps the area already ruptured in 1942 by a similar earthquake. However, we find that coseismic slip in 2016 exceeds the deficit accumulated since 1942. The seismic moment of every large earthquake during the twentieth century further exceeds the moment deficit accumulated since 1906. These results, together with the seismic quiescence before 1906 highlighted by historical records and marine palaeoseismology, argue for an earthquake supercycle at the Ecuador–Colombia margin. This behaviour, which has led to an enhanced seismic hazard for 110 years, is possibly still going on and may apply to other subduction zones that recently experienced a great earthquake.","tags":["eq_src cycle"],"title":"Supercycle at the Ecuadorian subduction zone revealed after the 2016 Pedernales earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"5564bb5dd55b0b51295a25a579ba2c91","permalink":"https://asladen.github.io/project/epost/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/epost/","section":"project","summary":"E-POST stands for Early-POSTseismic.

Over the few seconds or minutes of its duration, earthquake ruptures can go through various stages of acceleration, arrest, large slip or no slip. Given our inability to directly measure what is happening on the fault, remote imagery of fault slip evolution on the fault is a key element to understand what controls earthquake ruptures. It is also a necessary step towards a finer description of the seismic cycle (how ruptures repeat over time), and the prediction of generated ground motions (what causes building destruction and tsunami waves).\nHundreds of studies have investigated this complexity using data, first mostly relying on data from the global seismic networks and then, around the 1990s, using satellite based technologies such as GNSS, InSAR or optical imagery.\nDespite the continuous development of instrumentation, earthquake ruptures (and by extension any slip episode on a fault) remain challenging to image: signals are always recorded at the surface, spatial and/or temporal resolution of data is usually limited, data might be biased (e.g. collected one month after the earthquake), our knowledge of the Earth structure is often limited, as well as the physics of the processes involved. To address these issues, my collaborators and I, have developped different methodological approaches to address a number of limitations:\n incorporate more data, of different types and sensitivies. In the case of well instrumented earthquakes, our description of earthquake rupture can be based on teleseismic data, near-field strong motion, tsunami, GPS, radar images and/or optical images (e.g. Bletery et al.,2014),\n analyze data with probabilistic (Bayesian) algorithms. This formalism limits the amount of ad hoc assumptions (e.g. regularisation, imposing a priori information which is not well defined), and allows to estimate uncertainties on our final models (e.g. Simons et al., 2011; Bletery et al., 2016),\n devise a formalism to acknowledge model (epistemic) uncertainties. We show that this type of development leads to more robust images of fault slip history. It is a necessary approach given that our knowledge of the Earth structure will always be, at least to some extent, limited (e.g. Ragon et al., 2018),\n explicitely account for limitations of the measurements. Very often, data are acquired at the wrong time, with limited spatial coverage, or else. By developping strategies to acknowledge these limitations, it is possible to improve the robutness, and sometimes resolution, of the sought-after model (e.g. Bletery et al., 2018; Ragon et al., 2019),\n move towards more advanced physics (forward problem), when possible and useful.
