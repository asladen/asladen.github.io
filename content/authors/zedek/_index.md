Florian is analyzing and modeling the perturbations caused by earthquakes and tsunami in the ionosphere. The ionosphere observations are derived from GNSS data. We anticipate these data will valuable information on earthquake and for tsunami early-waring. Lucie Rolland is the main supervisor of this Ph.D. project. Co-supervisors include Dylan Mykesell (Boise University, USA) and Bertrand Delouis (Géoazur, Univ. Côte d'Azur, FR).
