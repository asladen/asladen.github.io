Quentin Bletery did his PhD at Géoazur - University Côte d'Azur from 2012 to 2015. He worked on the integration of multiple data to image the earthquake rupture, using both optimization and bayesian approaches. For this work, he received a satisfecit from the Ph.D award committee of "Le Monde".
After a postdoc at University of Oregon, USA, he is now a permanent IRD researcher at Géoazur.
