Welcome! I'm a CNRS researcher in geophysics, working at [Géoazur](https://geoazur.oca.eu), the Earth Science laboratory of [University Côte d'Azur](http://univ-cotedazur.fr/en) and the [Côte d'Azur Observatory](https://www.oca.eu/en/). <br>
My research aims mainly at better understanding earthquakes. More specifically, my work focuses on the study of the earthquake source, seismic cycle, global seismicity and seafloor instrumentation. I'm currently the PI of the ["SEAFOOD" ANR project](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE04-0007) aiming at developing of dense and affordable seafloor instrumentation based on fiber optic cables. <br>

At Géoazur, and within our dynamic [Seismology team](https://geoazur.oca.eu/fr/membres-equipe-seismes-geoazur), we often have opportunities for students interships and visitors so feel free to contact us.
