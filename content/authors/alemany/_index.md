Hector Alejandro Perez Alemany is working on seismic wavefield simulations to investigate the impact of 3D Earth heterogeneities on earthquake source imagery. This work is done in collaboration with (Vadim Monteiller)[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vadim_Monteiller] from the LMA lab, Marseille. This work is co-supervised by (Bertrand Delouis)[https://twitter.com/bertranddelouis?lang=en].
